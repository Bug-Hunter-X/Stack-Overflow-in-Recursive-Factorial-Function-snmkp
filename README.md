This repository contains a Python program demonstrating a stack overflow error that can occur when using a recursive function to calculate factorials.  The `bug.py` file shows the flawed recursive implementation, and the `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected, iterative implementation to avoid the error. The recursive implementation suffers from stack overflow when large inputs are provided due to exceeding the recursion depth limit.
